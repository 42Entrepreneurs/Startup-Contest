# Organize a Startup Contest @42entrepreneurs

This readme aims at facilitating organizing Startup Contests at 42.

## Goal of SPC üöÄ

Sartup contest are made to help people with startup ambitions get to the next level.
At the end of the contest, they'll have access to investors, mentorship, and more.
For 42entrepreneurs it's also an acquisition channel to spot startups that may not come to the Side Project Club.

## What is it ‚öôÔ∏è

A selection phase, with up to 80 startups applying (our record). We take a full week to let everyone pich their startup.
We select up to 15 startup after that, that will go to final phase.
We contact alumnis and organize workshops and office hours to coach the startups before the final.
The first startups win prizes. We try to provide value to everyone that participated (once we organized a visit of Station F with Xavier Niel with everyone for example).



## Organisation üíÇ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Week 1 : Advertisement
 * Advertise about the contest in 42 with flyers, @channels, etc.
